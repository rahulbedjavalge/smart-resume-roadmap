🚀 Project: “Smart Resume Analyzer + Career Roadmap Generator”
🧠 Project Idea
Build a web app where a user uploads their resume (PDF), and the system:

Extracts skills, experience, and education.

Matches them to job roles from current job descriptions (JD).

Identifies skill gaps using AI.

Generates a personalized 6-month career roadmap (courses, projects, tools).

Bonus: Rewrites resume bullets using LLM for better impact.

✅ Step-by-Step Plan
🧩 Week 1 - Part 1: Resume Parsing + Skill Extraction
 Extract text from PDF using PyMuPDF

 Use regex + NLP (SpaCy) to extract:

Skills

Work history

Education

 Normalize skills using a predefined skill ontology

📊 Week 1 - Part 2: Matching to Job Market
 Scrape or use sample JDs (Software Engineer, AI Engineer, Data Analyst)

 Extract required skills

 Use cosine similarity (TF-IDF or SentenceTransformers) to compare resume vs JD

 Rank best-matched job roles

🛠️ Week 2 - Part 1: Career Roadmap Generation
 Use a prompt to LLM like:

“Given current skills A, and desired job B, and skill gaps C, generate a 6-month roadmap of skills + projects + courses.”

 Output in structured format (Markdown or table)

✨ Week 2 - Part 2: Streamlit App + Bonus
 Upload resume → show parsed details

 Choose target role → get roadmap

 Optionally: Auto-rewrite resume lines with LLM

 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
